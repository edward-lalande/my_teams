# my_teams

The aim of the my_teams project is to recode a server and a client like Microsoft's Teams.

To achieve this, we have implemented our protocol and the commands required (specified in the EPITECH-myTeams-Protocol(PET).txt file, which contains the commands and our protocol).

## Usage

Make sure to have the package `libuuid-devel` if not, download it with you package manager and to export the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the ./libs/myteams/ folder.

```sh
    make
```
